<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>
  The Green Mile is a 1999 American fantasy drama film written, directed and
  co-produced by Frank Darabont and based on the 1996 novel of the same name by
  Stephen King.
</p>
<p>
  It stars Tom Hanks as a death row prison guard during the Great Depression who
  witnesses supernatural events following the arrival of an enigmatic convict
  (Michael Clarke Duncan) at his facility. David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Sam
  Rockwell, and James Cromwell appear in supporting roles.
</p>
<p>
  The film premiered on December 10, 1999, in the United States to positive
  reviews from critics, who praised Darabont's direction and writing, emotional
  weight, and performances (particularly for Hanks and Duncan), although its
  length received criticism. It was a commercial success, grossing $286 million
  from its $60 million budget, and was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best
  Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Duncan, Best Sound, and Best Adapted
  Screenplay.

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
  Howl's Moving Castle (Japanese: ハウルの動く城, Hepburn: Hauru no Ugoku Shiro)
  is a 2004 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao
  Miyazaki.
</p>
<p>
  It is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by British author Diana
  Wynne Jones. The film was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli
  and distributed by Toho. The Japanese voice cast featured Chieko Baisho and
  Takuya Kimura, while the English dub version starred Jean Simmons, Emily
  Mortimer, Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Josh Hutcherson and Billy Crystal.
</p>
<p>
  The film is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early
  twentieth-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with
  another kingdom. It tells the story of Sophie, a young milliner who is turned
  into an elderly woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She
  encounters a wizard named Howl and gets caught up in his resistance to
  fighting for the king. Influenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the United
  States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, the film contains strong anti-war themes.
  Miyazaki stated that he "had a great deal of rage" about the Iraq war, which
  led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the United
  States.[1] It also explores the theme of old age, depicting age positively as
  something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains feminist
  elements as well, and carries messages about the value of compassion.

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>
  Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war film directed by Steven
  Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat.
</p>
<p>
  Set in 1944 in Normandy, France during World War II, it follows a group of
  soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), on a mission to locate
  Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home safely after his
  three brothers have been killed in action. The cast also includes Edward
  Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg
  and Jeremy Davies.
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by the books of Stephen E. Ambrose and accounts of multiple soldiers
  in a single family, such as the Niland brothers, being killed in action, Rodat
  drafted the script, and Paramount Pictures hired him to finish writing it. The
  project came to the attention of Hanks and Spielberg, whose involvement, due
  to their previous successes, secured the project's development. Spielberg
  wanted to make Saving Private Ryan as authentic as possible and hired Frank
  Darabont and Scott Frank to do uncredited rewrites based on research and
  interviews with veterans.
</p>
<p>
  The main cast went through a week-long boot camp to help them understand the
  soldier's experience. Filming took place from June to September 1997, on a
  $65–$70 million budget, almost entirely on location in England and Ireland.
  The opening Omaha Beach battle was the most demanding scene, costing $12
  million to film over a four-week period, and using 1,500 background actors.
